I am a software developer with backgrounds in computational linguistics and machine learning. I studied computer science and linguistics at [Indiana University in Bloomington](http://iub.edu/), [Purdue University in Fort Wayne](https://www.pfw.edu/), [Asian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.th/) in Bangkok.

My past experience includes working at [Southpaw Technology Inc.](https://southpawtech.com/), [the LINGUIST List](https://linguistlist.org/), [the Center for Research in Computational Linguistics](http://sealang.net/) (Southeast Asian Languages Archive) and teaching at the Myanmar Institute of Theology.

I have worked on some of these projects:

- [Endangered Languages Catalog](http://endangeredlanguages.com/): a worldwide effort to share knowledge and resources for endangered languages
- [MultiTree](http://multitree.org/): a searchable database of hypotheses on language relationships
- [Southeast Asian Linguistics Archives](http://sealang.net/sala)
- SEALang [Burmese](http://sealang.net/burmese/), [Mon](http://sealang.net/mon/), [Shan](http://sealang.net/shan/) and [Karen](http://sealang.net/karen/dictionary.htm) dictionaries
- SEALang [Thai](http://sealang.net/thai/), [Khmer](http://sealang.net/khmer) and [Lao](http://sealang.net/lao/) dictionaries


I enjoy working on projects that encompass mathematics, computer science and linguistics. I wrote my Master's thesis on the [Automatic Bitext Alignment for Southeast Asian Languages](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7ZEOyKXVhn1bk5LMF9pRy0xUUU/edit?usp=sharing). I also like music and travelling. I play guitar and sing during my leisure. I love travelling to Southeast Asian countries and learning about their languages.
